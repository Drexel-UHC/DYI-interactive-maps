# DYI interactive maps

Request: "Is there a way to make interactive maps without having to reach out to DMC"

Project proposal: Build an intuitive analytics tool which allows users who don't know how to use ESRI the ability to create interactive maps and potentially plots/tables to visualize spatial data.
